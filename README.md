QWOPtiplayer
============

Multiplayer QWOP - Like twitch plays pokemon, now with more democracy

What this is actually a simple node js sever which take all touchs from the front end of each client connected to it and then emits back the most popular key pressed. This democracy intiates teamwork as only the most pressed key is actually pressed.
Essentially what this QWOPtiplayer is, is actually a democratic, realtime button presser or DRBP for short.

===============
Mac Only

We're sorry people but it's only been written with the Mac Control module in node, so it won't work on windows.
